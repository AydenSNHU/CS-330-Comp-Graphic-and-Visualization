How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software like I approach anything else that is going to work for me in the future. If I do good work now, then later on it will pay me back. For example, if I am making sure that my code is reusable, then making it once will allow me to continue to use it and approve upon in the future. By doing this, I can ensure that all my work is as good quality as it can be.


How do I approach developing programs?

This question is essentially the question above, and my answer stays true. Whenever I code now, if I do it with the mindset that doing it well will really help me in the future, then I can ensure that all my code in the future will benefit from it too. In addition, if I code with a set of strict principles now, and I stick to them, then they will help me stay accountable in the future.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Learning computer science doesn't just help me reach my goals, but it rather is my goals. Anything I have ever had interest in in the past has had to do with computer science, whether it be basic redstone circuitry from playing Minecraft as a kid, building computers now, doing 3D modeling on the side, or coding my programs and data bases for crypto mining. By learning computer science, it won't just help me in my professional life, but it will also help me enjoy my personal life more too!
